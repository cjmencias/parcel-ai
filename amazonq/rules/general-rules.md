Business Rules override User Stories, which override Examples - always follow this precedence and cite the section used when conflicts arise.

Include comprehensive unit tests for every code change covering happy path, edge cases, error handling, auth checks, and state transitions.

All code outputs are for development/demo only using sandbox endpoints - never interact with live services or real charges.

Always update README.md with current project structure, API documentation, libraries used, prerequisites, and step-by-step instructions for running the project.
